selim does dotfiles
===================

Simple dotfile configuration for my own use.

Run

```
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selimober/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

Inspired by [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [isa/environments](https://github.com/isa/environments)
